@REM  The code should compile easily with most C popular compilers. It uses
@REM  mostly C89 with standard library, no third party dependencies.
@REM
@REM  To compile on Windows, install visual studio (download is free) and run
@REM  this script to setup environment variables. Maybe the path needs to be
@REM  adapted.
@REM
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
@REM
@REM  Once the environment variables are setup, you can run build.bat as often
@REM  as you like...
